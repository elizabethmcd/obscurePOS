# Genome-Resolved Metagenomics of a Photosynthetic EBPR Bioreactor 

This repository contains code and workflows for genome-resolved metagenomics of a photosynthetically operated bioreactor simulating enhanced biological phosphorus removal. Raw metagenomic data and all 86 assembled MAGs are available on NCBI at [Bioproject PRJNA704939](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA704939). The _Microbiology Resource Announcements_ [publication](https://mra.asm.org/content/10/18/e00244-21) describing the study and dataset is published as:
